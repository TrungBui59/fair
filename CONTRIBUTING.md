# Contributing to FAIR

FAIR exists to make distributed systems fairer and more predictable under resource constraints. We welcome contributions from the community and appreciate your time and effort in helping the project grow.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- Use the Bug Report or Feature Request templates when opening issues.
- Be clear and specific: what’s the expected vs. actual behavior? Steps to reproduce?
- Include environment details (Go version, OS, runtime).

### Proposing Changes
- Before starting large changes, open an issue to discuss your idea.
- Fork the repo and create a feature branch (`feature/my-cool-change`).
- Write clear commit messages (present tense, short, descriptive).

### Submitting Pull Requests (PRs)
- Keep PRs focused — smaller PRs are easier to review and merge.
- Include tests where possible. If it’s hard to test, explain why.
- Update documentation and examples if your change affects usage.
- Be open to review feedback: the goal is clarity, correctness, and long-term maintainability.

## Review & Acceptance
All contributions are reviewed by project maintainers. Reviews consider:
- Correctness: Does the change solve the problem as intended?
- Efficiency: Is the implementation performant and resource-aware?
- Clarity: Is the code clean, well-structured, and readable?
- Tests: Are there adequate tests to cover edge cases?
- Docs: Is user-facing documentation updated where needed?

Feedback will be constructive and aimed at helping you get your contribution merged.

Maintainers make the final decision on acceptance, but the process is transparent — we’ll explain rejections and suggest paths forward.

## Code Style & Standards

Follow Go’s standard formatting (`go fmt`).
Keep functions and packages focused; avoid large, monolithic changes.

Write clear names for variables, functions, and tests.

## Community Values

- Be respectful and collaborative.
- No idea is too small — even typo fixes or doc improvements are valuable.
- FAIR is about fairness: we aim for fairness in both systems and our community.
